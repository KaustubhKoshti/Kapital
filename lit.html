            <div class="content">
                <p>Financial literacy refers to the understanding of key financial principles and the ability to apply them in managing personal finances. Here are the common challenges people face:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lack of essential knowledge:</strong> Many people lack basic financial skills to manage their money effectively, which can lead to poor decision-making.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure of expensive loans:</strong> Students, especially, face the challenge of managing costly education loans, often without guidance on repayment or budgeting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spending habits:</strong> Overspending and reliance on credit cards are major financial pitfalls, often resulting in accumulating debt and no emergency fund.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad financial advice:</strong> Poorly informed financial advice, especially from untrustworthy sources, can exacerbate financial difficulties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenience over savings:</strong> People often prioritize convenience—buying on credit or through costly subscriptions—rather than focusing on savings and investments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social influences:</strong> Peer pressure and lifestyle influences, such as keeping up with friends, often lead to overspending and poor financial decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Missed opportunities:</strong> Lack of awareness about government schemes like Jan Dhan Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, and tax-saving opportunities leads to missed savings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security risks:</strong> Ignorance about protecting personal financial information increases the risk of financial fraud and identity theft. Never share OTPs or banking details with strangers.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="collapsible">Financial Fraud</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Financial fraud involves deceptive activities that cause financial loss to individuals or organizations. Below are the most common forms of financial fraud:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> This involves stealing someone's personal information to commit fraud, such as applying for credit cards or loans in their name.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Card Fraud:</strong> Unauthorized use of a person's credit card information for fraudulent purchases or cash withdrawals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ponzi Schemes:</strong> Fraudulent investment scams promising high returns with little or no risk, often paying earlier investors with money from new investors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Deceptive emails or messages trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords and banking details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance Fraud:</strong> False claims or deliberate misrepresentations made to receive payouts from insurance companies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bank Fraud:</strong> Illegal activities such as forging checks, embezzlement, or hacking into bank accounts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To protect yourself from financial fraud, take these precautions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor your bank and credit card statements regularly for unauthorized transactions.</li>
                    <li>Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication for all your financial accounts.</li>
                    <li>Never click on suspicious links or provide personal information via email or phone to unknown sources.</li>
                    <li>Report lost or stolen cards immediately to your bank.</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- Third Section: Essential Financial Principles -->
        <div id="centered-section" class="section">
            <h2 class="collapsible">Essential Financial Principles</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Understanding key financial principles is critical to managing wealth successfully. Here are the essential financial principles everyone should know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Budgeting:</strong> Create a monthly budget that tracks all your income and expenses. This helps avoid overspending and ensures you’re saving regularly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Save at least 3-6 months of living expenses in an easily accessible account to cover unforeseen events like job loss or medical emergencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compound Interest:</strong> Start saving or investing early to take advantage of compound interest, where interest is earned on both the initial investment and the interest that accumulates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt Management:</strong> Focus on paying off high-interest debt, like credit cards, as soon as possible. Avoid taking on new debt unless necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Scores:</strong> A good credit score opens doors to favorable loan terms and lower interest rates. Pay bills on time and keep your credit utilization ratio low.</li>
                    <li><strong>Investing Early:</strong> The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow. Diversify your investments to balance risk and reward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money over time. Protect yourself by investing in assets like stocks or real estate, which typically outpace inflation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> Start contributing to retirement accounts as soon as possible. The power of compound growth will significantly increase your savings over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Protect yourself and your family by having adequate health, life, and property insurance. This shields you from significant financial loss in case of emergencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk and ensure stability in your portfolio.</li>
                    <li><strong>Setting Financial Goals:</strong> Clearly define your short-term and long-term financial goals, and regularly review your progress. Breaking them into smaller, manageable steps makes them easier to achieve.</li>
