            <p>
                KAPITAL began as an idea to create a tool for improving financial literacy and planning. After brainstorming and planning sessions, we started development by setting up the core features of the platform. We are currently in the testing phase and plan to launch the platform soon, adding more educational resources and features in future updates.

            <h2 class="section-header">Motivation & Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Our team is passionate about financial literacy because we believe it's a vital skill that everyone should have. We were inspired by the lack of accessible financial education resources and wanted to create something that could make a difference in people's lives by helping them take control of their finances.
